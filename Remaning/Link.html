	<p>Varun, a military doctor working in the Indian Army Medical Corps is a strict and practical person. While returning home from an operation, he receives a voicemail from his fiancée, Padmini, who urges him to call off their upcoming wedding. While enquiring about her sudden change-of-decision with her family. Padmini belittles him for being emotionally distant and apathetic. While leaving, Varun and Padmini's family learns that Chinnu has gone missing. The family lodges a complaint with the police – which in turn appoints Bhagat, a low-ranking police officer, to monitor the family's communications.

Disillusioned with the police's sluggish progress, Varun plots to kidnap the daughter of the ACP, believing that the resulting investigation would be more competent. His plan works, and the police nab almost every major criminal related to child-kidnapping. Varun singles out three criminals (Kamala Kannan, Kamesh, and Prathap), noticing that they were present around Chinnu's school at the time of her disappearance. Varun sedates them, and interrogates them by blackmailing them with their kidneys; he had apparently removed. Kamala Kannan confesses to kidnapping Chinnu, and handing her over to a child-trafficking network. Varun recruits one of the kidnappers Pratap and two gangsters, Mahaali and Killi, to assist in his investigation.

Varun's search leads him to twins Alvin and Melvin, both of whom are responsible for child-trafficking and prostitution. Varun and Padmini's family confront the duo in the Chennai Metro, and succeed in separating the duo and abducting Alvin. Desperate to save Alvin, Melvin concedes to release only one girl from his group of kidnapped girls. Although Chinnu is among them, Varun demands Melvin to release all the girls, despite Padmini's objections. Melvin refuses, but hints that the girls are being taken to Goa. Varun, Pratap, Mahaali, Killi and Padmini's family follow Melvin to Goa, where they discover that the true mastermind behind the recent kidnappings is Terry, the owner of a high-end resort. Varun orchestrates a drama, in which he has Mahaali and Killi and Padmini act as if the duo were kidnapping her and simultaneously has Padmini's family urge Terry to find her.</p>
